## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we interact with technology. They power applications from chatbots to advanced text generation tools. The **LLM Docker Starter** simplifies the deployment of these models, allowing developers to focus on building applications rather than dealing with setup complexities.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Get started with just a few commands.
- **Docker Compose**: Manage multi-container applications effortlessly.
- **Customizable**: Modify configurations to fit your needs.
- **Pre-configured Models**: Start with popular models ready for use.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides to help you along the way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gurdayals246/llm-docker-starter.git
   cd llm-docker-starter
   ```

2. Download the necessary files from the releases section:

   Visit [here](https://github.com/gurdayals246/llm-docker-starter/releases) to download the latest release. Follow the instructions in the release notes for installation.

### Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command starts all the necessary containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 

## Usage

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8000`. From here, you can interact with the models and test their capabilities.

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- **/generate**: Generate text based on a prompt.
- **/status**: Check the status of the model.

Refer to the documentation for detailed usage of each endpoint.

## Configuration

The configuration files are located in the `config` directory. You can adjust the settings to customize the behavior of the models. 

### Example Configuration

```yaml
model:
  name: "gpt-3"
  max_tokens: 100
```

## Examples

### Text Generation

To generate text, send a POST request to the `/generate` endpoint with a JSON body containing your prompt.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Once upon a time"
}
```

The response will contain the generated text.
